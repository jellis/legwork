### SeaEssEss

Light(er) CSS framework initially based on an amalgam of Zurb Foundation 3 and 5... includes IE8 support and some
sexy things for forms etc.

### Dependencies
- SASS
- Compass

... that's pretty much it at this stage. But I've updated the README.md

### Items included thus far
- Modals - animation included because a bind hack has been included... woot!
- Alerts (user messages)
- Flex Video player - AWESOME!
- Panels... just because
- Pagination
- Dropdowns
- Button dropdowns
- Split buttons (with dropdown) [this has now been removed - I didn't see the need for them]
- Tooltips
- Off Canvas menu for mobile/table devices

### TODO
- Ability to include web fonts
- Refactor js library - currently entirely Foundation namespaced
- Datepicker

### UPDATE
- Dropdowns now have a nice drop-shadow applied to them
- Split buttons were pointless and have been removed
- Borders have been reinstated on buttons
- Colour scheme has been changed to something a little more inline with Gmail (looks good, why not use it?)
- Fixed some rendering issues with button groups
